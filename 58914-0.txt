This book is divided into two parts, the first of which is mainly
concerned with the reconstruction of a Polish State after the victorious
close of our war against the Central Empires, a policy to which the
Governments of the Powers of the Entente, including America, have
repeatedly given expression both in independent and in joint utterances.
In this part an attempt is made to set forth how Poland will form an
indispensable link in the cordon of free states which will for all time
prevent Germany from penetrating Eastwards at will, absorbing the
countries through which she eats her way until she lays hands on Egypt
and India, and there follows on the disintegration of the British Empire
her domination of the world.
